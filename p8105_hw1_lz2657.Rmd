# Problem 1

First, I create the required data frame:

```{r}
problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_unif = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_unif > 2,
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("right","left","right","right","left","right","right","left","right","left"))
)

problem1_df
```
